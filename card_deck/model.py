"""Provides Card, Pile, and Deck classes for modelling cards, with Suits and
Faces enums as backend data structures

Suits and Faces are enums containing the names and values of their respective
items. Card models a single card, Pile models an ordered list of cards of
arbitrary length, and Deck models a Pile of cards containing every permutation
of suit and face, initially ordered by the enum values.
